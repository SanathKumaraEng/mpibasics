If the stored records are string data, hashing has to be used to convert strings into 
hash values and then conpare the hash values.

----- PSUDO CODE -----
Read the search queries from the search_queries.txt file into a list of query rows.
Open the CSV file.
Calculate the number of records per process based on the size of the CSV file and the number of processes.
Calculate the start and end indices for the current process based on the rank.

Iterate over the records in the CSV file using the start and end indices:
    Read a row from the CSV file.
    Calculate the hash value for the current row using a hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256).
    
    Iterate over the query rows:
        Calculate the hash value for the current query row using the same hashing algorithm.
        If the row hash matches the query hash:
            Print or store the matching row.
    Continue to the next row in the CSV file.

Close the CSV file.
Exit the program.
